# CLAUDE.md

Context for Claude sessions working in this repo: Daniel's talk on how he uses Claude day to day as a
software engineer. The deck is built and live; every slide has content, and what's left is a few visuals, real
examples from his work, and rehearsing the live demos (open questions at the end). The original design is in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-coding-not-typing-design.md`; later decisions below supersede it.

## Repo

Public repo `sutantyo/ai-talk-2026` (renamed from `ai-essentials-interactive` on 2026-10-07). Live at
https://sutantyo.github.io/ai-talk-2026/.

Everything for the talk lives under one parent folder (a plain folder, not a repo); on Daniel's MacBook,
the one he presents from, that's `~/repos/uni/2026-ai-talk/`:

```
2026-ai-talk/
├── slides/                     this repo (sutantyo/ai-talk-2026): the deck, the spec, this file
├── japanese-phrasebook-demo/   sutantyo/japanese-phrasebook-demo: the skills demo (see below)
├── blender/                    the MCP demo: its own .mcp.json with a Blender MCP, plus pre-built Python scripts
└── wordle-demo/                only words.js: ANSWERS and ALLOWED word lists for 4 to 7 letters (about 1 MB)
```

Wordle is built live on stage; `wordle-demo/` holds only the prepared word lists (keep anything else out: Claude
reads what's in the folder). `words.js` (2026-10-08): `ANSWERS[n]` are common words (Google's 10,000 most common, no
swears, names/places/brands removed: about 1,000 to 1,300 per length), `ALLOWED[n]` the dwyl/english-words
dictionary (7,186 to 41,998 per length). The answer lists are wrapped for editing; a header comment explains it.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `slides/slides.md` | The deck ([Slidev](https://sli.dev) v53, Vue 3 + Vite): title, the map, then each section's slides, with speaker notes |
| `slides/topics.ts` | **Every node on the map**: title, teaser, main point or sub-section, `optional`, position. Also the visited state and talk order |
| `slides/components/Hub.vue` | The map: circuit tree, sub-sections radiating out on hover, details card, visited dots |
| `slides/components/TitleTree.vue` | Title-slide decoration: an L-shaped circuit in the bottom-right corner (fixed drawing, not from `topics.ts`) |
| `slides/components/LearningGraph.vue` | "Learning backwards": a book as a tiered chapter graph; buttons play reading in order (breadth-first to chapter 13) and working backwards (13, 10, 7) |
| `slides/components/PromptCard.vue` | The Wordle prompt as a terminal-style card with a **Copy** button (put the prompt between `<PromptCard>` tags) |
| `slides/components/DocViewer.vue` | Scrollable plain-text document with section-jump buttons and a line count; used by the two below |
| `slides/components/ClaudeMdViewer.vue` | "A real CLAUDE.md": this file, read at build time. **Shown to the audience**, so keep it current and readable |
| `slides/components/SkillViewer.vue` | "Skill Example": the phrasebook's `add-phrases` skill, from the copy in `slides/examples/add-phrases-SKILL.md` (re-copy if the skill changes) |
| `slides/global-top.vue` | On every slide: section marker top-right, Map button bottom-right, end-of-section nudge |
| `slides/slide-bottom.vue` | Under each slide: a warm paper background (`--optional-bg`) on slides in an optional section |
| `slides/setup/shortcuts.ts` | Keys: arrows run along a main point's chain of pages and stop at its ends; `H` = map; → / ← on the map |
| `slides/style.css` | Colours (`--deep`, `--teal`, `--orange`), heading underline, bullets, the prompt card, key words (`.key`) |
| `slides/public/` | (to create) static files, e.g. screenshots, videos |
| `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` |

Commands: `cd slides && npm install && npm run dev` (http://localhost:3030, presenter view at `/presenter/`);
`cd slides && npx slidev build` (production build, also run by CI).

History: the repo previously held an interactive machine learning deck for Prof Christophe Doche's lecture.
It was removed deliberately; it's preserved at the `ml-deck` tag. Machine learning is out of scope for this talk.

### Lessons learned with this stack

- Every claim and number on a slide must come from something actually run or checked.
- Slidev class-name clashes: don't use `statement` (a built-in layout class) or `slider` as class names, nor
  `h1`/`h2`/`h3` (UnoCSS reads them as height utilities).
  The default theme greys out the first `p` after an `h1`; override with `.slidev-layout h1 + p { opacity: 1 }`.
- Fetch files in `public/` via `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` so the site works under `/<repo>/`.
- CI only has this repo: copy anything a slide shows from a sibling folder into it (as with the skill example).
- Pages: the workflow builds with `--base /<repo>/` and copies `index.html` to `404.html` so direct slide
  links (`/12`) load. They return HTTP 404 but render the deck, which is expected.
- Slidev turns off text selection on slides (`selectable` is off), so anything Daniel needs to copy on stage needs
  a copy button or `user-select: text` (as in `PromptCard.vue`).
- Turn off code-font ligatures (`font-variant-ligatures: none`); `==` and `->` otherwise render as symbols.
- Browser checks: Playwright from inside `slides/` (`playwright-chromium` is a dev dependency). Slidev keeps
  neighbouring slides in the DOM, hidden, so use `>> visible=true` locators. "Wake Lock permission denied"
  in headless browsers is harmless. `npx slidev export --format png` renders every slide for a visual check.
- Check in Safari too (Daniel presents from a Mac): Playwright's WebKit is installed (`import { webkit } from
  'playwright-core'`). Safari paints a round line cap for a zero-length dash, so a "hidden" `stroke-dashoffset`
  trace with round caps leaves a dot; hide it with `opacity: 0` as well.
- Commit and push only when Daniel asks.

## The talk: agreed plan

**Audience:** university students with **little to no coding background**. No code on slides beyond plain-English
prompts; explain terms like file, terminal, app. **Length:** 25 minutes core, plus up to 5 flexible minutes
covered by optional sub-sections. **Main message:** software engineering is still worth learning, because the skill has
moved from typing to directing and judging. Secondary: use AI well for your own learning.

**Daniel's own lines (keep his wording):**

- **Coding ≠ Typing.** "I'm still coding, I'm just not typing." The title and headline.
- **Claude is a smart Google.** Google gives you ten links; Claude reads *your* code and answers *your* question.
- **100 vs 50 vs 20** (reworded 2026-10-07). In his field he's still better than Claude (he hopes): 100 vs maybe 50.
  But in many jobs that don't need deep thinking he's maybe a 20, so Claude's 50 is much better. Don't try to be 100 at
  everything; be 100 at something, and Claude won't make you obsolete. (The earlier "at 0 you can't tell when the 50
  is wrong, which is why the degree matters" is off the slide, kept in its notes.)
- **The biggest change is the writing, not the code.** AI writes his documentation, so it's much cleaner: wiki
  entries, issues, pull requests. He sees this as a bigger change than AI writing code. Say it without jargon
  (team handbook, to-do and bug list, "what I changed and why" notes for review).

**Naming:** the deck says "Claude Code" only as the product name (intro slides, the Claude Code slide, the map);
the Claude Code slide then says "From here on, we'll just call it Claude", and the rest says "Claude".

**Structure: a map.** The hub slide is a circuit-tree map: the trunk is the main points in order; each point's
**sub-sections** branch off it in orange and radiate out on hover (scattered above and below, left to right in talk
order); an **optional** one has a dashed halo and its slides a warm paper background. A main point and its
sub-sections form one chain: the arrow keys run along it and stop at its ends. `H` or the Map button goes to the
map, and → on the map opens the next part of the talk. Current map (source of truth: `slides/topics.ts`), with
each part's slides:

## Demos

**Wordle, built live** (decided 2026-10-07). A Wordle-style browser game called "Guess the Word" (not "Wordle",
a New York Times trademark that has had GitHub clones taken down; the repo name `wordle-demo` is fine). Stage steps:
`cd ~/repos/uni/2026-ai-talk/wordle-demo` → `claude --effort low` → the prompt on the Wordle slide → `open index.html`.
Delete `index.html` between rehearsals; keep `words.js`. Publish later as `sutantyo/wordle-demo` with GitHub Pages
(the older repo of that name was deleted by Daniel on 2026-10-07).

**Measured 2026-10-07: the live Wordle prompt** (Claude Code 2.1.292, Opus 5.5, plugins off, headless, one run each).
The prompt: *"Make a Wordle-style game called "Guess the Word" as a single web page in this folder: five-letter
words, six guesses, green, yellow and grey tiles that handle repeated letters correctly, and an on-screen keyboard
that changes colour too. Use the word lists in words.js for answers and allowed guesses. Don't run any tests."* →
**40 s**, about US$0.24, with the big 2026-10-08 word lists (it didn't read the whole 1 MB file). Earlier, with a
504-word list: 31 s; without "Don't run any tests.": 38 s; at default effort: 51 s; with Claude
writing its own word list instead of words.js: 66 s and 73 s. All built a working game (repeated letters correct,
nonsense guesses rejected). Live, Claude may still ask once to run a command; that pause isn't in the times. Fast
mode untested.

**Measured 2026-10-06, the earlier plan** (Claude Code 2.1.290, headless; quote these, don't round them up). The
vague prompt *"Make a Wordle clone that runs in the browser, in this folder."*: **97 s**, 8 steps, about US$0.43.
It worked, but Claude decided things nobody asked: it **accepted any five letters** (`XQZZV`), typed a 542-word list
from memory, and called itself "Wordle". Now the contrast in the Wordle slide's notes. A live change to that older
repo (*"Change the game so words are 6 letters instead of 5."*) took **39 s**, and GitHub Pages served it **about
44 s** after the push. Its `CLAUDE.md` said not to read its 1 MB word file, and Claude didn't.

**Skills: `japanese-phrasebook-demo`** (decided 2026-10-07; public, `sutantyo/japanese-phrasebook-demo`).
A local, offline version of Daniel's online Japanese phrasebook (whose real version uses an MCP connector, which
is why it couldn't host skills): Svelte 5 page + Fastify + SQLite (`node:sqlite`), a `phrase` command with no
delete, and three project skills (`add-phrases`, `add-variation`, `review-phrases`) written in plain English to
show on screen, plus its own `CLAUDE.md` (rules: only change phrases through `phrase`, never reset). The page
updates live when the command writes, so the audience sees phrases arrive; seals speak with the Mac's Japanese
voice (Kyoko). Run: `npm start` → http://localhost:4173; `npm run demo:reset` between rehearsals.
Measured 2026-10-07 (headless, Claude Code 2.1.287): *"Add some phrases for buying medicine at a pharmacy"*
→ Claude chose `add-phrases` on its own and added 6 phrases in a new Pharmacy collection in **24 s**. It ended
questions with 「。」 where the book uses 「？」; that rule was then added to the skill (a real "this is what a skill
is for" example). Live, the skill shows the phrases and waits for Daniel's OK before adding. The Skills slide keeps
it simple ("tell Claude the skill's name"), so either name it in the demo or call the automatic pick a bonus.

**MCP: Blender** (decided 2026-10-07; Blender 5.1.2). Set up in `2026-ai-talk/blender`; Blender already open on
stage, not a cold start. DaVinci Resolve was considered and dropped: an MCP server needs its external scripting,
which is Studio-only (paid), and the free edition lost Python scripting entirely in v21.1. Aseprite MCPs exist but
run Aseprite in the background on files, so the audience wouldn't see the app being driven.

**Stage setup:** run Claude Code without Daniel's personal plugins (the impeccable design hook made Claude spend its
final message on design warnings in earlier runs). The laptop needs `gh auth login`; Claude asks permission before
pushing, which can be an audience moment.

**Keep a known bug for a live fix** (decided 2026-10-07). On the map, a visited sub-section's faded line (opacity
0.35) and faded circle (0.5) overlap, so the join looks darker. **Don't fix it.** Daniel will fix it live as an
example of "I still need to understand the problem to direct Claude" (the fix: fade the whole branch group once,
not each part). It comes up on the "So am I still coding?" slide ("explain it to the AI agent, e.g. the hub page").

## Ideas not taken (yet)

- **Session replay:** a recorded Claude Code session stepped through on clicks, terminal on one side and a
  plain-English line per step on the other. **Agent loop diagram** lit up with it.
- **Spot the bug** (Wordle's repeated-letter rule: answer `ABIDE`, guess `SPEED`, only one E coloured), an
  **"Allow this?"** permission prompt vote, **you be Claude**.
- **"Why not just use an API?"** backup slide for MCP: an MCP server is an interface designed for the agent; you
  choose what it can do. Analogies: USB-C; "the API is the kitchen, MCP is the menu". (The Blender MCP is the
  opposite case: it runs any Python.)
- Wordle-specific skills (theme, word packs, ship, playtest): poor uses of skills.

## Open questions for Daniel (2026-10-08)

- Visuals for "Making AI videos" (Higgsfield screenshots); the QR code on the closing slide.
- "Claude is a smart Google" isn't on any slide yet.
- Real examples from his work: the intro story, the jobs where he's a 20 (100 vs 50 vs 20), Monitoring.
- Stale speaker note: MCP ("read, not delete" doesn't fit a Blender MCP that runs any Python).
- Rehearsals: the Wordle prompt in an interactive session, the Blender demo (not timed yet), and a full timed run
  (the Claude Code section, ~10 min, is tight).
